For when we imported supabase in Auth Context:

---

1. Sign Up Function

`const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({ email: email, password: password });`

This line attempts to register a new user using their email and password. It uses the `signUp()` method from Supabaseâ€™s `auth` object. The response is split into `data` and `error`.

`if (error) { return { success: false, error }; }`

Here, we check if there was an error during sign-up. If so, we return an object stating the sign-up failed.

`return { success: true, data };`

If there was no error, the sign-up was successful. We return a success object with the user data.

ðŸ‘‰ **Why itâ€™s written this way:**
Returning an object like `{ success: true, data }` or `{ success: false, error }` makes it easier to handle the outcome later on, especially if youâ€™re using this function somewhere else in your code.

2. Checking Session on Load

`supabase.auth.getSession().then(({ data: { session } }) => { setSession(session); });`

This line asks Supabase for the current session (i.e., is someone already logged in?). The response contains a `session` object, which we store in our React state using `setSession()`.

ðŸ‘‰ **Why it matters:**
If a user refreshes the page or comes back later, we want to know whether they're still logged in. This line does that check on app load.

3. Watching for Login/Logout Changes

`supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange((_event, session) => { setSession(session); });`

This line sets up a live listener that reacts whenever the user's login status changes â€” for example, when they log in, sign out, or verify their email.

ðŸ‘‰ **What it does:**
Every time the auth state changes, Supabase will send us the new `session`, and we store it again using `setSession(session)`. This keeps the app in sync with the userâ€™s status.

4. What These Pieces Are

* **supabase**: This is your Supabase client, created using:
  `const supabase = createClient('your-project-url', 'your-public-api-key');`

* **email and password**: These are the values the user enters, typically stored using Reactâ€™s `useState()` like this:
  `const [email, setEmail] = useState('');`
  `const [password, setPassword] = useState('');`

* **setSession**: This is your React setter for the session state, also defined with `useState()` like:
  `const [session, setSession] = useState(null);`
